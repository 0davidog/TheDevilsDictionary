        "description": "One forgotten of the gods and living to a great age. History is abundantly supplied with examples, from Methuselah to Old Parr, but some notable instances of longevity are less well known. A Calabrian peasant named Coloni, born in 1753, lived so long that he had what he considered a glimpse of the dawn of universal peace. Scanavius relates that he knew an archbishop who was so old that he could remember a time when he did not deserve hanging. In 1566 a linen draper of Bristol, England, declared that he had lived five hundred years, and that in all that time he had never told a lie. There are instances of longevity ('macrobiosis') in our own country. Senator Chauncey Depew is old enough to know better. The editor of 'The American', a newspaper in New York City, has a memory that goes back to the time when he was a rascal, but not to the fact. The President of the United States was born so long ago that many of the friends of his youth have risen to high political and military preferment without the assistance of personal merit. The verses following were written by a macrobian:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young the world was fair<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amiable and sunny.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brightness was in all the air,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the waters, honey.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jokes were fine and funny,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statesmen honest in their views,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in their lives, as well,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you heard a bit of news<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas true enough to tell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men were not ranting, shouting, reeking,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor women 'generally speaking.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summer then was long indeed:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lasted one whole season!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparkling Winter gave no heed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ordered by Unreason<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring the early peas on.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, where the dickens is the sense<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calling that a year<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which does no more than just commence<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the end is near?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young the year extended<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From month to month until it ended.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not why the world has changed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To something dark and dreary,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everything is now arranged<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a fellow weary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Weather Man -- I fear he<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has much to do with it, for, sure,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is not the same:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It chokes you when it is impure,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When pure it makes you lame.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With windows closed you are asthmatic;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open, neuralgic or sciatic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I suppose this new regime<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dun degeneration<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems eviler than it would seem<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a better observation,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has for compensation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some blessings in a deep disguise<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which mortal sight has failed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pierce, although to angels' eyes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're visible unveiled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Age is such a boon, good land!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's costumed by a master hand!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite>Venable Strigg</cite>"

        "description": "Affected with a high degree of intellectual independence; not conforming to standards of thought, speech and action derived by the conformants from study of themselves; at odds with the majority; in short, unusual. It is noteworthy that persons are pronounced mad by officials destitute of evidence that themselves are sane. For illustration, this present (and illustrious) lexicographer is no firmer in the faith of his own sanity than is any inmate of any madhouse in the land; yet for aught he knows to the contrary, instead of the lofty occupation that seems to him to be engaging his powers he may really be beating his hands against the window bars of an asylum and declaring himself Noah Webster, to the innocent delight of many thoughtless spectators."
