        "description": "One forgotten of the gods and living to a great age. History is abundantly supplied with examples, from Methuselah to Old Parr, but some notable instances of longevity are less well known. A Calabrian peasant named Coloni, born in 1753, lived so long that he had what he considered a glimpse of the dawn of universal peace. Scanavius relates that he knew an archbishop who was so old that he could remember a time when he did not deserve hanging. In 1566 a linen draper of Bristol, England, declared that he had lived five hundred years, and that in all that time he had never told a lie. There are instances of longevity ('macrobiosis') in our own country. Senator Chauncey Depew is old enough to know better. The editor of 'The American', a newspaper in New York City, has a memory that goes back to the time when he was a rascal, but not to the fact. The President of the United States was born so long ago that many of the friends of his youth have risen to high political and military preferment without the assistance of personal merit. The verses following were written by a macrobian:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young the world was fair<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amiable and sunny.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brightness was in all the air,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the waters, honey.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jokes were fine and funny,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statesmen honest in their views,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in their lives, as well,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you heard a bit of news<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas true enough to tell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men were not ranting, shouting, reeking,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor women 'generally speaking.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summer then was long indeed:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lasted one whole season!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparkling Winter gave no heed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ordered by Unreason<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring the early peas on.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, where the dickens is the sense<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calling that a year<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which does no more than just commence<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the end is near?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young the year extended<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From month to month until it ended.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not why the world has changed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To something dark and dreary,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everything is now arranged<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a fellow weary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Weather Man -- I fear he<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has much to do with it, for, sure,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is not the same:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It chokes you when it is impure,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When pure it makes you lame.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With windows closed you are asthmatic;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open, neuralgic or sciatic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I suppose this new regime<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dun degeneration<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems eviler than it would seem<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a better observation,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has for compensation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some blessings in a deep disguise<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which mortal sight has failed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pierce, although to angels' eyes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're visible unveiled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Age is such a boon, good land!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's costumed by a master hand!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite>Venable Strigg</cite>"

To an understanding familiar with the relativity of magnitude and distance the spaces and masses of the astronomer would be no more impressive than those of the microscopist. For anything we know to the contrary, the visible universe may be a small part of an atom, with its component ions, floating in the life- fluid (luminiferous ether) of some animal. Possibly the wee creatures peopling the corpuscles of our own blood are overcome with the proper emotion when contemplating the unthinkable distance from one of these to another."

        "description": "A person engaged in reigning. Formerly the monarch ruled, as the derivation of the word attests, and as many subjects have had occasion to learn. In Russia and the Orient the monarch has still a considerable influence in public affairs and in the disposition of the human head, but in western Europe political administration is mostly entrusted to his ministers, he being somewhat preoccupied with reflections relating to the status of his own head."

As in Rome Christians were thrown to the lions, so centuries earlier in Otumwee, the most ancient and famous city of the world, female heretics were thrown to the mice. Jakak-Zotp, the historian, the only Otumwump whose writings have descended to us, says that these martyrs met their death with little dignity and much exertion. He even attempts to exculpate the mice (such is the malice of bigotry) by declaring that the unfortunate women perished, some from exhaustion, some of broken necks from falling over their own feet, and some from lack of restoratives. The mice, he avers, enjoyed the pleasures of the chase with composure. But if &quot;Roman history is nine-tenths lying,&quot; we can hardly expect a smaller proportion of that rhetorical figure in the annals of a people capable of so incredible cruelty to a lovely women; for a hard heart has a false tongue."

If many men of equal individual wisdom are wiser than any one of them, it must be that they acquire the excess of wisdom by the mere act of getting together. Whence comes it? Obviously from nowhere -- as well say that a range of mountains is higher than the single mountains composing it. A multitude is as wise as its wisest member if it obey him; if not, it is no wiser than its most foolish."
