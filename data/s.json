        "description": "A weekly festival having its origin in the fact that God made the world in six days and was arrested on the seventh. Among the Jews observance of the day was enforced by a Commandment of which this is the Christian version: 'Remember the seventh day to make thy neighbor keep it wholly.' To the Creator it seemed fit and expedient that the Sabbath should be the last day of the week, but the Early Fathers of the Church held other views. So great is the sanctity of the day that even where the Lord holds a doubtful and precarious jurisdiction over those who go down to (and down into) the sea it is reverently recognized, as is manifest in the following deep-water version of the Fourth Commandment:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the seventh holystone the deck and scrape the cable.<br><br>Decks are no longer holystoned, but the cable still supplies the captain with opportunity to attest a pious respect for the divine ordinance."

And is it not now 3:10?&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Son of a thousand illustrious deities,&quot; answered the condemned minister, &quot;all that you say is so true that the truth is a lie in comparison. But your heavenly Majesty's sunny and vitalizing wishes have been pestilently disregarded. With joy I ran and placed my unworthy body in the market-place. The executioner appeared with his bare scimetar, ostentatiously whirled it in air, and then, tapping me lightly upon the neck, strode away, pelted by the populace, with whom I was ever a favorite. I am come to pray for justice upon his own dishonorable and treasonous head.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To what regiment of executioners does the black-boweled caitiff belong?&quot; asked the Mikado. &quot;To the gallant Ninety-eight Hundred and Thirty-seventh -- I know the man. His name is Sakko-Samshi.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let him be brought before me,&quot; said the Mikado to an attendant, and a half-hour later the culprit stood in the Presence. &quot;Thou bastard son of a three-legged hunchback without thumbs!&quot; roared the sovereign -- &quot;why didst thou but lightly tap the neck that it should have been thy pleasure to sever?&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lord of Cranes of Cherry Blooms,&quot; replied the executioner, unmoved, &quot;command him to blow his nose with his fingers.&quot; Being commanded, Jijiji Ri laid hold of his nose and trumpeted like an elephant, all expecting to see the severed head flung violently from him. Nothing occurred: the performance prospered peacefully to the close, without incident.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes were now turned on the executioner, who had grown as white as the snows on the summit of Fujiama. His legs trembled and his breath came in gasps of terror. &quot;Several kinds of spike-tailed brass lions!&quot; he cried; &quot;I am a ruined and disgraced swordsman! I struck the villain feebly because in flourishing the scimetar I had accidentally passed it through my own neck! Father of the Moon, I resign my office.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, he gasped his top-knot, lifted off his head, and advancing to the throne laid it humbly at the Mikado's feet."

Sometimes it is stamped upon wax, and attached to the paper, sometimes into the paper itself. Sealing, in this sense, is a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing important papers with cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical efficacy independent of the authority that they represent. In the British museum are preserved many ancient papers, mostly of a sacerdotal character, validated by necromantic pentagrams and other devices, frequently initial letters of words to conjure with; and in many instances these are attached in the same way that seals are appended now. As nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless custom, rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote utility, it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense evolving in the process of ages into something really useful. Our word &quot;sincere&quot; is derived from _sine cero_, without wax, but the learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence of the cabalistic signs, or to that of the wax with which letters were formerly closed from public scrutiny. Either view of the matter will serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis. The initials L.S., commonly appended to signatures of legal documents, mean _locum sigillis_, the place of the seal, although the seal is no longer used -- an admirable example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the beasts that perish. The words _locum sigillis_ are humbly suggested as a suitable motto for the Pribyloff Islands whenever they shall take their place as a sovereign State of the American Union."

Plato held that those souls which in a previous state of existence (antedating Athens) had obtained the clearest glimpses of eternal truth entered into the bodies of persons who became philosophers. Plato himself was a philosopher. The souls that had least contemplated divine truth animated the bodies of usurpers and despots. Dionysius I, who had threatened to decapitate the broad- browed philosopher, was a usurper and a despot. Plato, doubtless, was not the first to construct a system of philosophy that could be quoted against his enemies; certainly he was not the last.<br><br>&quot;Concerning the nature of the soul,&quot; saith the renowned author of _Diversiones Sanctorum_, &quot;there hath been hardly more argument than that of its place in the body. Mine own belief is that the soul hath her seat in the abdomen -- in which faith we may discern and interpret a truth hitherto unintelligible, namely that the glutton is of all men most devout. He is said in the Scripture to 'make a god of his belly' -- why, then, should he not be pious, having ever his Deity with him to freshen his faith? Who so well as he can know the might and majesty that he shrines? Truly and soberly, the soul and the stomach are one Divine Entity; and such was the belief of Promasius, who nevertheless erred in denying it immortality. He had observed that its visible and material substance failed and decayed with the rest of the body after death, but of its immaterial essence he knew nothing. This is what we call the Appetite, and it survives the wreck and reek of mortality, to be rewarded or punished in another world, according to what it hath demanded in the flesh. The Appetite whose coarse clamoring was for the unwholesome viands of the general market and the public refectory shall be cast into eternal famine, whilst that which firmly through civilly insisted on ortolans, caviare, terrapin, anchovies, _pates de foie gras_ and all such Christian comestibles shall flesh its spiritual tooth in the souls of them forever and ever, and wreak its divine thirst upon the immortal parts of the rarest and richest wines ever quaffed here below. Such is my religious faith, though I grieve to confess that neither His Holiness the Pope nor His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury (whom I equally and profoundly revere) will assent to its dissemination.&quot;"

The truth of the stories here following has, however, not been successfully impeached.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One evening Mr. Rudolph Block, of New York, found himself seated at dinner alongside Mr. Percival Pollard, the distinguished critic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mr. Pollard,&quot; said he, &quot;my book, _The Biography of a Dead Cow_, is published anonymously, but you can hardly be ignorant of its authorship. Yet in reviewing it you speak of it as the work of the Idiot of the Century. Do you think that fair criticism?&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am very sorry, sir,&quot; replied the critic, amiably, &quot;but it did not occur to me that you really might not wish the public to know who wrote it.&quot;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. W.C. Morrow, who used to live in San Jose, California, was addicted to writing ghost stories which made the reader feel as if a stream of lizards, fresh from the ice, were streaking it up his back and hiding in his hair. San Jose was at that time believed to be haunted by the visible spirit of a noted bandit named Vasquez, who had been hanged there. The town was not very well lighted, and it is putting it mildly to say that San Jose was reluctant to be out o' nights. One particularly dark night two gentlemen were abroad in the loneliest spot within the city limits, talking loudly to keep up their courage, when they came upon Mr. J.J. Owen, a well-known journalist.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why, Owen,&quot; said one, &quot;what brings you here on such a night as this? You told me that this is one of Vasquez' favorite haunts! And you are a believer. Aren't you afraid to be out?&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; the journalist replied with a drear autumnal cadence in his speech, like the moan of a leaf-laden wind, &quot;I am afraid to be in. I have one of Will Morrow's stories in my pocket and I don't dare to go where there is light enough to read it.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rear-Admiral Schley and Representative Charles F. Joy were standing near the Peace Monument, in Washington, discussing the question, Is success a failure? Mr. Joy suddenly broke off in the middle of an eloquent sentence, exclaiming: &quot;Hello! I've heard that band before. Santlemann's, I think.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't hear any band,&quot; said Schley.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come to think, I don't either,&quot; said Joy; &quot;but I see General Miles coming down the avenue, and that pageant always affects me in the same way as a brass band. One has to scrutinize one's impressions pretty closely, or one will mistake their origin.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Admiral was digesting this hasty meal of philosophy General Miles passed in review, a spectacle of impressive dignity. When the tail of the seeming procession had passed and the two observers had recovered from the transient blindness caused by its effulgence --<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He seems to be enjoying himself,&quot; said the Admiral.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There is nothing,&quot; assented Joy, thoughtfully, &quot;that he enjoys one-half so well.&quot;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illustrious statesman, Champ Clark, once lived about a mile from the village of Jebigue, in Missouri. One day he rode into town on a favorite mule, and, hitching the beast on the sunny side of a street, in front of a saloon, he went inside in his character of teetotaler, to apprise the barkeeper that wine is a mocker. It was a dreadfully hot day. Pretty soon a neighbor came in and seeing Clark, said:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Champ, it is not right to leave that mule out there in the sun. He'll roast, sure! -- he was smoking as I passed him.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;O, he's all right,&quot; said Clark, lightly; &quot;he's an inveterate smoker.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbor took a lemonade, but shook his head and repeated that it was not right.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a conspirator. There had been a fire the night before: a stable just around the corner had burned and a number of horses had put on their immortality, among them a young colt, which was roasted to a rich nut-brown. Some of the boys had turned Mr. Clark's mule loose and substituted the mortal part of the colt. Presently another man entered the saloon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For mercy's sake!&quot; he said, taking it with sugar, &quot;do remove that mule, barkeeper: it smells.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; interposed Clark, &quot;that animal has the best nose in Missouri. But if he doesn't mind, you shouldn't.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of human events Mr. Clark went out, and there, apparently, lay the incinerated and shrunken remains of his charger. The boys did not have any fun out of Mr. Clarke, who looked at the body and, with the non-committal expression to which he owes so much of his political preferment, went away. But walking home late that night he saw his mule standing silent and solemn by the wayside in the misty moonlight. Mentioning the name of Helen Blazes with uncommon emphasis, Mr. Clark took the back track as hard as ever he could hook it, and passed the night in town.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General H.H. Wotherspoon, president of the Army War College, has a pet rib-nosed baboon, an animal of uncommon intelligence but imperfectly beautiful. Returning to his apartment one evening, the General was surprised and pained to find Adam (for so the creature is named, the general being a Darwinian) sitting up for him and wearing his master's best uniform coat, epaulettes and all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You confounded remote ancestor!&quot; thundered the great strategist, &quot;what do you mean by being out of bed after naps? -- and with my coat on!&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam rose and with a reproachful look got down on all fours in the manner of his kind and, scuffling across the room to a table, returned with a visiting-card: General Barry had called and, judging by an empty champagne bottle and several cigar-stumps, had been hospitably entertained while waiting. The general apologized to his faithful progenitor and retired. The next day he met General Barry, who said:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Spoon, old man, when leaving you last evening I forgot to ask you about those excellent cigars. Where did you get them?&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Wotherspoon did not deign to reply, but walked away. : &quot;Pardon me, please,&quot; said Barry, moving after him; &quot;I was joking of course. Why, I knew it was not you before I had been in the room fifteen minutes.&quot;"
