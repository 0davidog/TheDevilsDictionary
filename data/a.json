The animal is widely and variously celebrated in the literature, art and religion of every age and country; no other so engages and fires the human imagination as this noble vertebrate. Indeed, it is doubted by some (Ramasilus, lib. II., De Clem., and C. Stantatus, De Temperamente) if it is not a god; and as such we know it was worshiped by the Etruscans, and, if we may believe Macrobious, by the Cupasians also. Of the only two animals admitted into the Mahometan Paradise along with the souls of men, the ass that carried Balaam is one, the dog of the Seven Sleepers the other. This is no small distinction. From what has been written about this beast might be compiled a library of great splendor and magnitude, rivalling that of the Shakespearean cult, and that which clusters about the Bible. It may be said, generally, that all literature is more or less Asinine.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Hail, holy Ass!' the quiring angels sing;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Priest of Unreason, and of Discords King!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great co-Creator, let Thy glory shine:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God made all else, the Mule, the Mule is thine!'<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite>G.J.</cite>"
