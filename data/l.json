        "description": "A part of the earth's surface, considered as property. The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society, and is eminently worthy of the superstructure. Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area of 'terra firma' is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A life on the ocean wave,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A home on the rolling deep,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the spark the nature gave<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have there the right to keep.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They give me the cat-o'-nine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I go ashore.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then ho! for the flashing brine --<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a natural commodore!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite>Dodle</cite>"
